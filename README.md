## üìå Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end **sales dashboard** for *Myntra*, built using **Power BI** for dynamic visualization and **MS SQL Server** for robust backend data handling.

The dashboard is designed to track key performance indicators (KPIs), visualize customer behavior, and provide business insights such as revenue by brand, product performance, state-wise sales, and more.

## üîß Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** ‚Äî For dynamic, interactive dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft SQL Server** ‚Äî Used as the primary data source for querying and validating KPIs.
- **SQL** ‚Äî Core querying language for data manipulation and validation.
- **DAX (in Power BI)** ‚Äî For custom metrics and calculated columns.

## üóÑÔ∏è SQL Backend Logic

All KPIs and visuals are validated using SQL queries. The queries are saved in [View Full SQL KPI Queries](https://github.com/srk5555/Myntra_Data_Analysis-/blob/main/SQL_Kpis.sql)
. Below is a glimpse of the structure:

### üìå Sample SQL Queries Used

```sql
-- Database Creation
CREATE DATABASE myntra_DataAnalysis;
USE myntra_DataAnalysis;

-- Sample KPI Calculation
SELECT SUM(original_price) AS original_sales_amt FROM fact_table;
SELECT SUM(discounted_price) AS total_sales_amount FROM fact_table;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS total_products FROM fact_table;
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders FROM fact_table;
SELECT ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_ratings FROM fact_table;

-- Visuals: Total Sales by Brand
SELECT brand_name, SUM(discounted_price) AS total_sales_amount
FROM fact_table
GROUP BY brand_name
ORDER BY total_sales_amount DESC;
